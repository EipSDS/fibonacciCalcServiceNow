ServiceNow REST Service and UI to retrieve the Fibonacci Sequence given a number.

Option 1:
Instructions,Testing, and Technical information are contained within the update set itself as a Knowledge article.

Once the update set is commited, the UI can be used and Knowledge Article can be accessed withing a ServiceNow instance. Knowledge article number is KB0010004 - short description Fibonacci Calculator. Navigate to Fibonacci Calculator module within Self Service to test UI and web service within ServiceNow.

Option 2:
Use any REST tool such as Postman or Google's  REST ARC and perform a simple GET request against https://dev24089.service-now.com/api/79385/v1/fibonacci?num=n providing 'n' as the parameter to invoke web service and view the results.

Also uploaded a .word file of the ServiceNow KB if working outside ServiceNow, although formatting is off coming from an HTML Knowledge article.
